**Divoom Proxy for ESP32**

Allows you to send commands to your Divoom device through various protocols. It works as a companion for my [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/d03n3rfr1tz3/hass-divoom),
but you can also use it as standalone communicator for your Divoom devices. Currently the following input protocols are either implemented or planned. You can find more information
in the documentation below.

* **Serial**
* **TCP**
* MQTT (ToDo)
